# Replit Setup and Hosting

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up the Replit development environment for Highrise bots. It will take you step-by-step, from creating your first Repl, installing the Highrise Python SDK and its dependencies, to deploying your first Highrise bot. Furthermore, it will demonstrate how to leverage Replit's `Always On` feature, ensuring that your bot remains active 24/7.

We encourage you to follow along with the video tutorial to ensure a successful setup and understanding of how to maintain a constant bot presence in Highrise. Your journey into Highrise bot development and hosting starts here.

## **Step 1: Setting Up Replit Account**

1. Create an account on Replit, an online coding platform that allows us to write, run, and host our bot's code directly in a browser.
2. After logging in, you'll be taken to your home page. From here, click the **`+`** button in the top left to create a new "repl", which is a programming environment for a specific project.

## **Step 2: Creating Your Python Environment**

1. Select the Python template and name your repl (this name won't affect anything in-game, it's just for your reference on Replit).
2. Once you've created a repl, you'll be taken to the coding environment. On the left side, you'll see a file explorer, in the middle, a code editor, and on the right, a terminal where you'll input commands to run your bot.

## **Step 3: Adding the Highrise Python SDK**

1. Add the Highrise Python SDK dependency to your project. To do this, open the **`pyproject.toml`** file and add the latest version of the SDK. As of now, it's **`highrise-bot-sdk = "23.1.0b10"`**.

1. Update the dependencies by going to the shell tab on the right and executing the command **`poetry update`**. This command updates all of the dependencies to their latest versions according to the restrictions specified in the **`pyproject.toml`** configuration file. It's important to perform this step; otherwise, our code won't work.

## **Step 4: Adding Your Bot Code**

1. In the **`main.py`** file, add your bot code. For this tutorial, copy the **[Echo](https://create.highrise.game/learn/guides/bots/examples/basics)** bot from the Highrise Create Portal.
2. Ensure you have two important pieces of information: your bot's API token and the Room ID. The room should be one where you have owner or designer privileges.

## **Step 5: Running Your Bot**

1. In the shell tab, execute the following command, replacing **`<bot_class>`**, **`<room_id>`**, and **`<api_token>`** with your actual bot class name, Room ID, and API token respectively:
    
    ```python
    highrise main:<bot_class> <room_id> <api_token>
    ```
    
2. If "start" is printed to the screen, your bot has successfully connected to the server, and the basic setup is complete.

## **Step 6: Configuring the "Run" Button**

1. To make the big "Run" button functional, edit the hidden **`.replit`** file.
2. Click on the three dots at the top right of the file explorer, and select **`Show Hidden Files`**. You can find the **`.replit`** file there.
3. Delete the entire code block under the **`interpreter`** block (lines 15 to 27).

4. Replace the **`run`** command with the same command that runs your bot. For example, replace **`python3 main.py`** with the appropriate Highrise command as described in Step 5.

## **Step 7: Hosting Your Bot 24/7**

1. To keep your bot active even after closing your Replit tab or shutting down your computer, use Replit's `Always On` feature.

2. This feature is accessible with a monthly subscription starting at $7/month for Replitâ€™s [hacker plan](https://replit.com/pricing). Alternatively, it costs 20 cycles per day, where a cycle is Replit's form of virtual currency.
3. Choose your preferred method of purchasing this feature, activate the `Always On` power up, and your bot will stay up and running 24/7, allowing it to interact with Highrise at all times.

**Note:** Please ensure the code running 24/7 does not violate any Highrise terms of service or create an unfriendly environment for other players. As responsible developers, it's our duty to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for everyone.
