![Blackjack (2).png](https://cdn-production.joinhighrise.com/create-portal/Blackjack_2_56994a55d8.png)

The Blackjack Bot is an interactive and engaging bot designed to facilitate a single lobby multiplayer blackjack game within your Highrise chat room. Using various chat-based commands, users can participate in a game of blackjack, making the Highrise experience more enjoyable and entertaining.

### **Usage:**

To begin playing blackjack with the bot, type the following command in the chat room where your bot is active to see the list of available commands:

```bash
/b help
```

Here are the other commands:

1. `/b create` - Create a blackjack game.
2. `/b start` - Start the blackjack game.
3. `/b join` - Join the blackjack game.
4. `/b lobby` - Show players in the blackjack game.
5. `/b hit` - Draw a card.
6. `/b stand` - End your turn.
7. `/b show` - Show the current cards on the table.
8. `/b quit` - Leave the blackjack game.
9. `/b yes` - Continue to play the next round.
10. `/b no` - Leave the blackjack game.
