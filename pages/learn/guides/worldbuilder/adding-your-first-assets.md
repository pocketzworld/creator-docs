## **Step 4: Import 3D Models:**
1. Ensure your 3D models are in the FBX file format. If they are not in this format, you may need to convert them using appropriate software.
2. Navigate to your 3D model files. Suppose you have a separate asset pack or directory. In that case, you can access it now.
3. Extract the FBX files from your chosen location.
4. Copy the FBX files you extracted from your asset pack.
5. Paste these files into the "Models" folder you created in your Assets Panel.
6. Return to the builder interface of your world-building software.
7. Check the Assets Panel to ensure that your new FBX files have been successfully added to your project.
