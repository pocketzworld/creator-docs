### **Step 1: Open World Builder and Create a New World**

1. Launch World Builder. Upon starting, you'll be greeted by the "Worlds Library."
2. Since we don't have any worlds yet, click "Create."
3. Choose a destination on your drive where you'd like to save your world. Create a new folder for your world within that location.
4. Click "Select Folder" to confirm your choice.

### **Step 2: Access the Main Room**

1. After creating your world, you might be taken directly to the first "Room" or "Scene." If not, double-click on the Room item labeled "Main" or “New Room”.

### **Step 3: Adjust Room Properties**

1. On the right-hand side, you'll find the Inspector window displaying properties for your selected object, which, in this case, is the Room.
2. Here are the properties you will see:
    - Player Prefab
    - Local Player Prefab
    - Sun Color
    - Ambient/Shadow Color
    - Background Color

### **Step 4: Setting Inside and Outside Colors**

1. All we want to worry about right now is the Background Color.
2. Select the Drop down menu and select Gradient
3. You have options for both Inside Color and Outside Color, represented as Hex Codes.

### **Step 7: Explore the Assets Folder**

1. Navigate to your world's folder and locate the "Assets" folder. This is where you can place your Rooms, Models, Scripts, and other assets.
