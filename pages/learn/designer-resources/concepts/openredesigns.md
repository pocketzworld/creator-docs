## Open Redesigns List

The Open Redesign List is a pilot program through which designers are empowered to freely share their catalogs with the rest of the art community. Departing from our usual guidelines, which prohibit item redesigns by anyone other than the original artist, items by Open Redesigns artists are available to the public. 

♻️ *These items are eligible to be redesigned by anyone in the community for any redesign Concept.* ♻️ 
They may not be used as bases for any regular Concept.  

### ✍️ Items attributed to the following designers are eligible for redesigning:

#### 📝 Redesigning From The List

For Redesign Concepts only (Rainbowify, Hot Take, Romantify, etc.) you may treat any item from any of the designers above as if it were a regular Highrise item. Designers on this list do not require collaboration requests, advance notice, or communication for you to start redesigning their work. 

_*Items that originally came from a collaboration are not eligible for redesign.*_ 🤝 If there are two names in the Attribution Field for any of the items listed above, please do not consider it open for redesigning. 

When you're ready to submit, please credit the original designer and include the name and image of the item you are redesigning. 


#### 📈 Submission Counts

All artists are limited to 10 total submissions across solo and collaborative work. 
However, since the Open Redesign artists are providing full access to their catalogs, there is no limit to item redesigns submitted by other community members.

#### 💸 Compensation

Any winning entry sourced from an Open Redesign item will be attributed to both the original artist and the new redesigner. Compensation of Earned Gold and items will also be divied equally (5,000 Earned Gold and 3 items apiece.)

#### ➕ Get Added To The List

Any item designer may be added to the Open Redesigns List. Just reach out to us and we'll make sure your name is appended!

#### ➖ Leaving The List

Request to be removed from the Open Redesign List by contacting our team. Please be sure to check our Concept Calendar, as we will not remove your name if a Redesign Concept is currently Live.
