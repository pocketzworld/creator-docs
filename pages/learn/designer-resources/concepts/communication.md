🎉 Congratulations! Your concept art is about to become a real item! Our artists craft each item specially with your work in mind, and our goal is to create something amazing that our whole Highrise community will value and love. 

The art creation process involves a few different stages: 

1. Setup
2. Concepting Stage
3. Vector Stage
4. Item finalized!

We will walk you through the process below. Buckle up and get ready for your next adventure! 🎉

## 1. 🥳You have been selected! 🥳

Before we get to work, we ask that you send any additional details, references, item break downs, and item names. 

- Please let us know if your items are supposed to pair with existing items or have similar attributes. For example, if your item is meant to layer with specific body parts, or share proportions with an existing item, let us know the item name. We will do our best to accommodate!
- If you are a vector artist feel free to send us your files! Let us know in the creator chat and we can update you how to send your files. (Be aware that we use our own discretion on when we use outside files!)
- We may modify your items to suit our style, especially if your own unique art style is quite different. Also, our team may combine or break apart items as needed (like adding socks + legs together, or separating hair + clips). We look at a multitude of factors when we select items and try to take in account our your preferences, but cannot always accommodate all requests!
- Depending on a variety of factors, such as the needs of the event, our team will select which items we’ll produce from your designs. While we always consider designer requests for items, rarity, and naming, we will make the final call for item selection and distribution.

## 2. ✏️Concepting Stage: (Our artists draw!) You relax! ✏️

Next, our artists start drawing your items! Our team uses your design as inspiration, and will always try to stay close to your design as possible. Sometimes we will have to make edits and changes — here are some common reasons:

- **Your design may be out of style for our game**. We try and maintain common lighting, rendering and folds so you can mix and match items and get a cohesive look! Take a look at our **[STYLE GUIDE](https://create.highrise.game/learn/designer-resources/artguides/drawing)** for more tips to draw in our style!
- **Your item is too detailed**. Our game displays in pixels, so fine details or small designs will blur out in the virtual world. Nobody wants to wear a blob! We want your item to look as good as it possibly can, so sometimes we have to simplify small details so that it will read crisp and clean in app.
- **Item layering and game limitations** can sometimes require us to make changes. In order for your item to move with our avatar base, stack with other items, and not glitch, we may make edits to accommodate for our game’s mechanics and limitations.
- Designers dream big, and sometimes request item capabilities that are not yet implemented in our game (such as animating hair or particular state changes). While many of these ideas are not possible YET, Highrise is constantly growing and changing. Hold tight for new features!

Whenever we make changes, we’ll always do our best to explain our reasoning or technical limitations, so please feel free to ask follow up questions! Our team has years of experience working in game development and vector art, and will do our utmost to make your design its best self for the community!

## 3. ✅Concept Preview window! Time for you to review ✅

Our artists have finished their interpretation of your design! We will send you a preview for you to review. Here is what we need from you!

- You have 48 hours to review the design, starting from when the preview image is sent. This is your time to look over the design and request changes, so please be as thorough as possible with your feedback on the design so far. Is the hair too long? Do you want it a brighter red? Let us know. Some feedback *during* the 48 hour window is better than *no* feedback after the 48 hour window! So please, send your edits ASAP 🕜
    - Feel free to send us draw overs and written notes. Being specific helps us make the correct edits and makes sure you are happy with the changes.
    - We will sometimes send a second preview after making major edits. We will do our best to let you know what edits we can and cannot make in writing if a second preview is not sent.

**Important things to keep in mind:**

1. We have limited time to meet our production schedule, so please make sure you are providing ALL feedback within the 48 hour window. Any feedback outside that window may not be considered.
2. We may have to make changes to your design. Please review the concepting phase section to see common reasons why we may need to make changes.
3. ALL design changes and requests need to be done within the concept stage! In the vector stage, any changes to the design will not be considered.
4.  Due to strict production times we may have to limit the number of edits. We’ll prioritize the most impactful changes first, and minor tweaks later.
5. Please flag any changes or edit requests in the creator chat. We will not consider outside sources like Discord for feedback or edits.
6. Please remain polite to our artists. Any player who is rude or does not adhere to the above conditions may be removed from future winnings. 

## 4.  🏝️Vector Stage! Relax you earned it! 🏝️

Our artists are cleaning up and converting the concept art into files Highrise uses for wearable clothing! This process takes a little while so expect the vector preview a few weeks after your initial concept preview.

## 5. 👀Vector Preview! Time to review 👀

Our artist will send you the finalized preview of your design. It's time to take one last look!

- You have 48 hours to review the design, starting from when the preview image is sent.
    - This is the time to look at the item’s layering and placement: any major changes should be addressed in concept preview phase. If the layering of an item is not obvious in our lineup, please reach out to us for clarification.
    - We will do our best to show you color previews for complex hair or clothing items, but just note that we do not send color previews for every color-changing item like hair or lips.

**Important things to note:**

1. We will not be making design edits during the vector phase; this is the time for final adjustments only. Please be aware that any major design edits requested during this stage will not be considered.
2. Due to our production schedule, we cannot include backside previews.
3. Please flag any changes or edit requests in the creator chat. We will not consider outside sources like Discord for feedback or edits.
4. Please remain polite to our artists. Any player who is rude or does not adhere to the above conditions may be removed from future winnings. 

## 6. 🎁Item in your inbox! 🎁

Before the items are released to everyone in the game, you will receive the items in your inbox. Try them on! We hope you will totally fall in love with them. 😄 We do our very best to make sure your items are tested and layer properly before we send them off… but sometimes we miss things. Please flag us in our creator chat so we can fix any issues before the event, sale, or grab goes live. 

At this point in the process, we are looking for layering errors and broken features.

1. We will not be making placement adjustments or design edits
2. We do not make design edits or placement changes to existing items or items that have been released for extended periods.
3. Please flag any changes or edit requests in the creator chat. We will not consider outside sources like Discord for feedback or edits.
