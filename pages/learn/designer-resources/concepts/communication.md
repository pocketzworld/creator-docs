If your Concept is selected, we’ll open a direct line of contact with our Art Team to help you transform your design into a real item! The Concepts tool features an integrated messenger, so you won’t have to leave the app’s webpage to keep the conversation going!

When the Concept ends, you’ll receive a message from our team, and your winning submission will get a groovy new **SELECTED** banner across the top.



Tap into your Selected Submission to open the messenger view. Throughout this process, you’ll receive messages from our Art Team directly in your Highrise Inbox. Once you’re in the Concepts web view, you’ll see a small notification bubble next to any Selected Submission with pending messages.

Our team will share updates on how your concept is progressing and ask questions as they come up. When your concept is ready for preview, we’ll share a sneak peek for your review.

**A Special Note for Collaborators**
Currently, our Messenger only supports chat with the artist who submitted the winning design. 
We're working to add functionality to create a multi-way chat for collaborators, but until then, please coordinate with your partner to view previews and share feedback! 

### Edit Requests

As a quick heads up, our production turnaround is pretty speedy. When we send previews, please share any edit requests with us as soon as possible; ideally, within 48 hours. Also, keep in mind that even if you send edit requests right away, we can’t guarantee that all changes will be implemented, due to an array of possible blockers (like technical layering issues, stylistic choices, time constraints, or significant departures from your original winning concept).

The Concepts messenger will close for your winning Submission about a week after your items go live. If you have any other feedback or concerns about your items after this period, please reach out to our Support Team for assistance.

After all edits are complete and your items are ready, we’ll send them to you as an Inbox Gift about 48 hours before they’re due to go live.
