## WHAT IS HIGHRISE IDEAS?
Highrise Ideas is our **crowdfunding platform**. Creatives on Highrise have no shortage of impressive item concepts, but like many artists, often need a bit of support to bring their unique visions to life. Highrise Ideas empowers the community to come together to forge a dream into reality. ü§ù

Similar to most crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter or IndyGoGo, Highrise Ideas is a tool to help artists share concepts for single wearable avatar items they‚Äôd love to make, and helps members of the community explore a library of designs they‚Äôd love to wear. 

Once you see an Idea that resonates with you, you can commit to supporting that item by **Preordering** it. 
üîñ Preordering works just like pledging or backing a project in Kickstarter: if the item gets enough support to meet its funding goal, it gets created, and all backers receive the item. If it doesn‚Äôt meet its funding goal, the Idea is cancelled and preorders are refunded. 

As the Highrise Ideas feature is still in it‚Äôs own embryonic stage, we‚Äôre ready to hear your ideas on what optimizations might best serve our creative community with future updates! The keys to _any_ idea becoming a reality are both adaptability and perseverance to keep trying, and that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre going to do. üí™

So let‚Äôs go! Share a concept for a single item, and get ready to rally around designs that get people buzzing. Every great moment, look, or experience starts somewhere, and that somewhere is an Idea. üí≠
### FUNDING PIPELINE

For an item to be released through Highrise Ideas, it will need to pass through three stages: 

**Review Phase**, in which Highrise Staff assesses eligible Ideas and approves valid designs

**Funding Phase**, a 30 day period for the item to receive public funding from the Highrise community

**Production Phase**, a 60 day period for the HR Art Team to create the item.

During **Funding Phase**, anyone who wants to support the Idea can do so by preordering the item for a 10% discount. Once an Idea reaches its Funding Goal, the item **immediately** enters a 60-day Production Phase. 

During the **Production Phase**, anyone may continue to preorder the item for full price. After Production concludes, the item will be distributed to backers automatically, and the item Designer will receive 10% of the total revenue in the form of Earned Gold. 

Items created through HR Ideas are _only purchasable_ during the Funding and Production Phases! After that, they may be traded, but are no longer available through Ideas or any other Highrise Shop.
