### FUNDING PHASE 

When you see an Idea that you‚Äôd love to support, click on the PRE-ORDER button to begin the preordering flow.

Next, you‚Äôll be shown a page displaying the item‚Äôs creation and pricing timeline. 

Choose how many items you want to preorder. You can order up to 10 items at a time; however TOTAL preorder purchases are unlimited. 

To buy more than 10 items, you‚Äôll have to submit your first order of 10, and then restart the preordering process to buy another batch.

Finally, after you select the item quantity, you‚Äôll see one final confirmation popup. 

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è ### ALL PREORDERS ARE FINAL. 
Once you back an Idea, there is NO WAY to rescind your support. 

If an Idea fails to fund, or if the item is removed by Staff, your pledged Gold will be refunded. Otherwise, all preorders are **permanent commitments**. 

You CAN preorder your own items! Sometimes, you just have to believe in yourself. üíÉ

Check on the progress of Ideas you‚Äôve supported by tabbing over the **My Pre-Orders** menu on the top navigation bar.
