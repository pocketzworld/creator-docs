Anything can be the source of inspiration for a great Idea! Item themes and clothing types are totally up to you. Here’s a quick checklist of what to consider as you design and share your item Ideas:

**👚 Wearable Avatar Items**   

Ideas is currently only accepting items to customize your avatar’s features (eyes, noses, hair, body shape), clothing, and accessories. 

**☝️ Single Items**    

Ideas allows individual pieces only. To streamline the explore features of our Ideas webpage, every Idea is showcased using just one image of the item design.
While some items might have built-in arms, legs, or accessories, we won’t approve any item that could potentially be released _as multiple items._ So if you design a hair item with built-in ears and hairclips, for example, your Idea may be rejected for containing three potential items instead of one.

**💡 Original Items**   

Share your fresh item designs! We are not accepting any redesigns in Highrise Ideas - even if you’re using your own designs as your base. Additionally, an Idea may not be approved if it is too similar to an existing item – _regardless_ of whether or not the similarity is intentional. Innovate and bring something totally novel to the Idea table!


**🌈 Fixed Colors**     

We only accept items that are "naturally" color changing: hair, eyes, lips, and blushes are all acceptable. 
We _do not_ accept item that wouldn't color change in real life (handbags, scrunchies, gowns, shirts, shoes, etc.). 

- **VALID COLOR CHANGE**: hair, lips, eyes, eyebrows, facial hair, clip-in bangs, freckles, blush. Additionally, items with built-in body parts (posed arms and legs, rider items, crop tops with exposed skin, items that tweak avatar body proportions) are all acceptable.
-  **INVALID COLOR CHANGE**: clothing, auras, makeup, or accessory items that change based on hair, skin, lip, or eye color. Items that color change according to an _unnatural_ color dependencies are also not valid (ie, hair that changes color according to eyes; eyes that color change according to lips, etc.)

</p>

_Body parts that typically have hair are considered valid for color-changing. Animal ears, tails, and other fur-or-scale-clad body parts may change color._

**📄 Appropriately Categorized Items**   

As you create your Idea submission, you’ll define the _item’s type and and rarity_. Review the item type categories (shirt, aura, lips, bag, etc.) to ensure that your item will layer properly; then, pick a rarity that matches the item’s approximate value (ie, a dazzling, bombastic pair of wings should not be a Rare).  

👛 **Commissioned Items**  

Have a great Idea, but don't feel confident in your artistic ability? You may commission a fellow Highrise artist to help bring your vision to life. However, please note that commissions are considered "_Trust Trades"_ – **all payment or compensation must be handled prior to your Idea submission.** Highrise is not responsible for ensuring commission payments are delivered. We are not able to add multiple designers to a single Idea at this time.

_**In your commissioned Idea submission, please use a tag on the item image and description stating that is commissioned work. Use “Commission from __” with your artist’s name so our team doesn’t accidentally remote your entry!**_    



## WHAT WE'RE NOT ACCEPTING ❌  

Ideas may be rejected by our team at any point! Here are some of the most common reasons why:


🛌 **Furniture Items**   
Items that may be placed in rooms or Worlds are not accepted at this time.

🧸 **Pets, or any type of Pet accessory**    

You can design static critters that can be worn on the avatar, or be posed next to your avatar: items "Pets" here specifically refers to animated companions like Moonpups, Hootkins, Snugglins, etc. 

🔫 **Guns**    

Handheld, slings, pistols, rifles, play guns, or holstered guns are not allowed. Get creative and come up with a fun, positive item to share!

👁️**Contact Lenses**   

Any item modifying an avatar's iris in shape, color, or other unnatural change won't be approved. Other types of body modifications, like changes to an avatar's face shape or body proportions, are welcome.

🖼️ **Profile Backgrounds** 

Stick to the wearables, please!

🔐 **Account Bound Items**

All Ideas items are released Tradable! We are not able to honor requests to make specific items permanently or temporarily Account Bound.


🦋**Animated Items**   

Moving wings, bobbing antannae, flicking tails, etc. are not accepted. 
All Highrise hair is currently "animated" by default (ie, all hair sways slightly when an avatar walks). 


⚖️™️ **Copyrighted Material**

No third-party Intellectual Property (IP) may be used in your submission. This includes...
- Trademarked logos or products
- Branded clothing, accessories, or items
- Fictional characters (anime, movies, games, comics, books, etc.)
- Franchise-based visual cues (colour schemes, weapon designs, creature designs, etc.)
- Celebrity likenesses or personas (No recognizable images of real people, celebrities, or public figures)
- Stock images or clip art

📹**Stock Elements**

Pre-fab brushes, templates, textures, or other graphic elements may not be included. You may use these tools in the creation of your Idea if they are licensed for commercial use, or if they do not compose the majority of your design. 
For example, you may use a free, publicly accessible sparkle asset to add an element of shine to a sequined dress that you designed yourself.

👭 **Collaborations**  

Items may not be submitted jointly. These differ from commissions! Collaborations assume fair credit and compensation splits amongst both contributors. However, we are unable to add more than one artist to any Idea campaign. 
If you are interested in working with another person, please explore **Commissions** mentioned above.   


####  NOTES

1. Ideas may be rejected by Highrise staff at any stage during the Funding or Production Phase for technical constraints, quality considerations, or community guideline infringements by the designer.

3. Submit under your own account! Duplicate entries submitted under alt accounts will be removed. 
4. You may submit any single-item design to **both Concepts and Ideas simultaneously**! If you happen to win a Concept vote, we'll take down the Idea campaign for you.
