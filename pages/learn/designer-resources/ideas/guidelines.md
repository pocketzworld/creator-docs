Anything can be the source of inspiration for a great Idea! Item themes and clothing types are totally up to you. Here’s a quick checklist of what to consider as you design and share your item Ideas:

**👚 Wearable Avatar Items**   

Ideas is currently only accepting items to customize your avatar’s features (eyes, noses, hair, body shape), clothing, and accessories.

**☝️ Single Items**    

Ideas accepts individual pieces only. While some items might have built-in arms, legs, or accessories, we won’t approve any item that could potentially be released as multiple items. So if you design a hair item with built-in ears and hairclips, for example, your Idea may be rejected for containing three potential items instead of one.

**💡 Original Items**   

Share your fresh item designs! We are not accepting redesigns in Highrise Ideas. Additionally, an Idea may not be approved if it is too similar to an existing item, regardless of whether or not the similarity is intentional.

A small exception to this rule is the use of BRANDING to create a unique line of bespoke items. If you are creating a brand around a particular item type (like shoes) or a specific aesthetic (like a curvy body shape), we provide greater flexibility in how you use your own item bases, styles, and rendering. Branding is limited to items originally released in HR Ideas; Concept entries are not eligible for use as future Ideas item bases. 

**🌈 Fixed Colors**     

We only accept items that are "naturally" color changing: hair, eyes, lips, and blushes are all acceptable. 
We _do not_ accept items that wouldn't color change in real life (handbags, scrunchies, gowns, shirts, shoes, etc.). 

- **VALID COLOR CHANGE**: hair, lips, eyes, eyebrows, facial hair, clip-in bangs, freckles, blush. Additionally, items with built-in body parts (posed arms and legs, rider items, crop tops with exposed skin, items that tweak avatar body proportions) are all acceptable.
-  **INVALID COLOR CHANGE**: clothing, auras, makeup, or accessory items that change based on hair, skin, lip, or eye color. Items that color change according to unnatural_ color dependencies are also not valid (ie, hair that changes color according to eyes; eyes that color change according to lips, etc.)

</p>

_Body parts that typically have hair are considered valid for color-changing. Animal ears, tails, and other fur-or-scale-clad body parts may change color._

**📄 Appropriately Categorized Items**   

As you create your Idea submission, you’ll define the item’s type and rarity. Review the item type categories (shirt, aura, lips, bag, etc.) to ensure that your item will layer properly; then, pick a rarity that matches the item’s approximate value (ie, a dazzling, bombastic pair of wings should not be a Rare).

👛 **Commissioned Items**  

Have a great Idea, but don't feel confident in your artistic ability? You may commission a fellow Highrise artist to help bring your vision to life. However, please note that commissions are considered "Trust Trades" – all payment or compensation must be handled prior to your Idea submission. Highrise is not responsible for ensuring commission payments are delivered.

In your commissioned Idea submission, please use a tag on the item image and description stating that it is commissioned work. Use “Commission from __” with your artist’s name so our team doesn’t accidentally remove your entry!

Currently, any Commissioned HR Idea items released in-game may include **attribution to both usernames**, upon request by the user who submitted the idea. In all collaborations and commissions, Gold division is decided by players.



## WHAT WE'RE NOT ACCEPTING ❌  

Ideas may be rejected by our team at any point! Here are some of the most common reasons why:


🤖 **AI Entries**   

🛌 **Furniture Items**   

🧸 **Pets, or any Pet accessory**    

🔫 **Guns**    

This applies specifically to rifles. Other firearms may be permitted but are subject to review.

👁️**Contact Lenses**   

🖼️ **Profile Backgrounds** 

Stick to the wearables, please!

🔐 **Account Bound Items**

All Ideas items are released Tradable! We are not able to honor requests to make specific items permanently or temporarily Account Bound.

🦋 **Animated Items**   

⚖️™️ **Copyrighted Material**

No third-party Intellectual Property (IP) may be used in your submission. This includes...
- Trademarked logos or products
- Branded clothing, accessories, or items
- Fictional characters (anime, movies, games, comics, books, etc.)
- Franchise-based visual cues (colour schemes, weapon designs, creature designs, etc.)
- Celebrity likenesses or personas (No recognizable images of real people, celebrities, or public figures)
- Stock images or clip art

📹 **Stock Elements**

Pre-fab brushes, templates, textures, or other graphic elements may not be included. You may use these tools in the creation of your Idea if they are licensed for commercial use, or if they do not compose the majority of your design. 
For example, you may use a free, publicly accessible sparkle asset to add an element of shine to a sequined dress that you designed yourself.
 

####  A NOTE ON STYLE

On the whole, Highrise’s art style lives on the border between realistic, highly rendered graphics and simple, cartoony styles. 

However, community concept art is as unique as each individual designer. Just take a look at our Ideas page to see an incredible diversity of styles! 
Part of our art team’s job is to translate the varied art styles from our community creators into the Highrise style for each successful Ideas campaign. Since our virtual world is founded on the ability to mix and match thousands of items to suit your personal expression, the ability to create a cohesive outfit from a catalog of looks with a unified aesthetic really matters. 

Because of this, some changes to your concept art style may be necessary. Highly detailed, rendered items may be simplified; flatter, less shaded concepts may be given more depth to bring them into style. 

Hair items in particular can be pretty tricky to get right, since they need to be mix-and-matchable with different fronts and backs. While we won’t reject an item for being too rendered, please note that very realistic, HD items will be brought more in line with the rest of our items.

Here are some examples of the level of rendering we’re able to give our hair items:

Up close, this is how we create our hair strands from deepest base shade, all the way up to the shiniest highlights.

####  NOTES


1. Ideas may be rejected by Highrise staff at any stage during the Funding or Production Phase for technical constraints, quality considerations, or community guideline infringements by the designer.
2. Highrise staff may adjust an item's details (name, rarity, and category) if necessary. Our art team may adjust an item’s appearance based on our technical limitations. This may affect proportions, hair layering, or rendering. See our Note On Style for more details. 
3. Submit under your own account! Duplicate entries submitted under alt accounts will be removed. 
4. You may submit any single-item design to **both Concepts and Ideas simultaneously**! We'll create whichever entry is successful first.
5. To account for the volume of Ideas we receive, we may not share personalized explanations for why an Idea was rejected. Of course, we always welcome resubmissions, so take a look over this list, reassess your Idea, and resubmit!
