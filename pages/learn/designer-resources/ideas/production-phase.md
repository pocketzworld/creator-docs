### PRODUCTION PHASE

The Production Phase is a 60 day chapter during which the Highrise Art Team communicates with the the Idea Designer to create the funded item. 

Once your Idea has been fully funded, youâ€™ll receive a message from our team to invite you to a 1-1 conversation with our staff artists. You can use this chat to share additional references, special notes, and review a sneak peek of your item before it goes live! 

**Throughout this phase, anyone may continue to preorder the item, in any amount, at full price.** This is the last time the item will be available for broad public purchase - after the item is released, it will only be available via trade.
