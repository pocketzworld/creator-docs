### RELEASED IDEAS

At the end of the Production Phase, celebrate your success! You’ve either created an awesome item, or had the bright idea to support something amazing. Either way, congrats! 

### Backers
Backers will find the newly released Idea item in the Gifts tab of their inbox with the label “PRE-ORDER REWARDS”. Items will begin to send immediately upon Production Phase closing, and send in staggered batches over the next hour or two.

### Creators

You'll receive your item when the Production Phase ends, along with your compensation. 
Designers will receive 10% of the total Gold raised for their Idea in the form of **Earned Gold.** 
Earned Gold may be used just like regular Highrise Gold, and it can also be redeemed for cash through our [Creator Exchange](https://create.highrise.game/dashboard/creator-exchange).  You can read our full guide to Earned Gold on our [FAQ](https://highrise.helpshift.com/hc/en/3-highrise---your-avatar-community/faq/193-earned-gold/).
