You can also sift through Ideas by Status, Rarity, type, designer name, or item name. If you’re not sure what to look for, try typing an evocative word into the search bar! When a designer creates an Idea submission, they can include tags to describe the item’s aesthetic, and help players find specific looks based on descriptors like “kawaii,” “leather,” or “fancy.”
