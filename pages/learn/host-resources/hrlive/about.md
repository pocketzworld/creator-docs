### What kind of events does HR Live sponsor?

If you can dream, we want to see it! HR Live sponsors a wide variety of events: from fierce pageants and round-table discussions, to sing-along nights and maze-building competitions. Whatâ€™s most important is that hosts know how to **engage and entertain** their audience. 
We encourage hosts to be as creative as possible, so submit your wildest ideas!
