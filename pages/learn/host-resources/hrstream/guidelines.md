**Lights, camera, YOU!** Hosting a Stream event in Highrise is about more than being on screen—it’s about bringing energy, connection, and your own personal flair. Here’s how to keep it fun, fresh, and friendly:

---

### 🌟 Be Expressive

Your face and voice are your superpowers. Don’t be afraid to:

- **Use facial expressions and body language** to engage your audience.
- **Speak clearly and confidently**—think of it like FaceTime with 1,000 new friends.
- **Crack jokes, banter, riff**—if it feels natural, go for it!

---

### 💬 Keep It PG-13

We want everyone to feel welcome.

- Avoid **explicit language**, offensive jokes, or inappropriate topics.
- Light innuendo or sass is okay—as long as it’s clever, not crude.

---

### ✨ Show Off Your Style

You’ve spent hours perfecting your avatar’s drip—your IRL self deserves the same.

- Rock outfits that **match your vibe** or event theme.
- Props, lighting, or fun backgrounds? Go for it!
- Keep it **stylish, not spicy**—avoid intentionally provocative or overly suggestive clothing. Let your *personality* do the talking.

---

### 🧠 Stay Cool in the Spotlight

Hosting an HR Stream event with live video is a very different experience from avatar-based hosting—and not always in a good way. Sometimes, bad actors will show up just to get a rise out of you.

- **Don’t engage with negativity or trolls.** Your energy is better spent highlighting the awesome folks in chat who are vibing with you.
- If someone says something **hurtful or makes you feel unsafe**, alert a staff member immediately so we can moderate as needed.
- Keep the focus on **positivity and connection**—the real ones will appreciate it, and the trolls don’t deserve your attention.

---

### 🎤 Upgrade Your Setup (If You Can)

Not required—but these help *a lot*:

- **Good lighting**: Ring lights, desk lamps, or window light = yes.
- **Noise-reducing mic**: A headset mic or USB mic can make your voice crisp and clear.
- **Stable connection**: Wi-Fi is fine, but Ethernet is better.

---

### 🚫 Don’t…

Just a few hard no’s to keep it safe and positive:

- No hate speech, bullying, or harassment of any kind.
- No intoxication or substance use on camera.
- No off-platform self-promotion (e.g., advertising Twitch/OnlyFans/etc.).

---

### ✅ Do…

- **Interact with your audience**—call them out by name, react to the chat, make it a two-way vibe.
- **Match the energy of the game or event**—whether it's trivia, bingo, or chaos, your tone sets the mood.
- **Have fun with it**—your authenticity is the secret sauce.
