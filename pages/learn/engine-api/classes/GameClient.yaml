name: GameClient
type: classes
summary: |
  In Highrise's scripting environment, the GameClient class acts as the high-level game context the script is running in. Any client-level interaction or manipulation will be found in this class. Specifically, scripts marked 'Client' or 'Client and Server' can access client - with 'Client and Server' requiring you to check if `client` is not nil (or `server` is nil).

  The GameClient is essential for managing critical client-specific activities, such as identifying the local player or the main camera. It also enables responding to events like the connection and disconnection of players during gameplay.

  It stands as the bridge between local operations and the expansive game environment, providing a hassle-free way to tap into and manage client-side functionalities.
