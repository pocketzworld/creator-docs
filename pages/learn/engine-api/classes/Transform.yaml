name: Transform
type: classes
summary: |
  The Transform class in Unity is a foundational component that all GameObjects in your game will have. It is used to store and manipulate the position, rotation and scale of your objects in the 3D space, which are fundamental parameters for 3D environments. Every GameObject has a Transform component attached, and it cannot be removed. To precisely understand how to best use Transform in your game, refer to the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html).
