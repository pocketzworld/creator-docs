name: transform
type: class
summary: |
  The data that defines the offset of an object in 3D space, including position, 
  rotation, and scale.
description: |
  The `class.transform` class is used to control the position, rotation,
  and scale of an object in 3D space. The most common use is 
  `class.entity.transform`.
  
  Keep in mind that anything with the term "local" here refers to the object's local 
  space, meaning relative to its parent. For example, if you have an entity that 
  is a child of another, and you set the child's LocalPosition to
  vector3.new(0, 0, 0), it will be positioned at the same location as its parent.
