name: Player
type: classes
summary: |
  The 'Player' class in Highrise represents each individual participant in the game. It is a crucial element, acting as the bridge between the player's real-world actions and their in-game avatar's behaviors. The class comprises the 'name' attribute of the players for easy identification, and an 'avatar' object that maps to the player's in-game character. It also includes event-based methods that respond to specific activities such as the instantiation and destruction of a player's avatar.
