name: Texture
type: classes
summary: |
  In the realm of Unity, the Texture class serves as the cornerstone for all texture-based entities. Think of textures as the digital equivalent of wallpaper, bringing color and detail to an otherwise uniform 3D model. It's the artist's palette in the 3D modeling process that breathes visual vibrancy into your game world.

  The Texture class encapsulates common properties and methods shared by all 2D textures and is the base class for more specific texture types, like Class.Texture2D, Class.Texture3D, and Cubemap textures. This unifying class offers a standardized way to modify and interact with textures, regardless of their specific type.

  No matter if you're tweaking the glossiness of an alien skin, projecting a starry night on a skybox using a Cubemap, or generating a procedural labyrinth with a Texture3D, the Texture class is the common thread binding these diverse operations.

  For a deeper dive into the Texture class and how this versatile tool helps paint elaborate graphics onto your Unity projects, the [official Unity Texture documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.html) is a comprehensive resource.

properties:
  - name: mipmapCount
    summary: |
      The 'mipmapCount' property returns the total number of mipmap levels present in the Texture. Mipmaps are a sequence of textures, each of which is a progressively lower resolution representation of the same image. They are used to increase rendering speed and reduce aliasing effects. You can learn more from the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-mipmapCount.html).

    code_samples:
    type: number
  - name: width
    summary: |
      The 'width' property represents the width of the texture in pixels. Knowing the dimensions of your textures can be crucial when working with UV mapping and texture application. The [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-width.html) provides additional insights into texture manipulation.

  - name: height
    summary: |
      The 'height' property specifies the height of the texture in pixels. Knowing the texture dimensions can be crucial when working with texture manipulation such as UV mapping. More information can be found in the [Unity's Texture documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-height.html).
    description:
    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    type: number
  - name: isReadable
    summary: |
      The 'isReadable' property is a boolean flag that states if the texture data can be read or not. If set to true, scripts can read the pixel data of the texture. This is important while doing any kind of processing on the texture's pixel data. You can learn more about it from the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-isReadable.html).

    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    type: boolean
  - name: anisoLevel
    summary: |
      The 'anisoLevel' property sets the Anisotropic filtering level of the texture. This filtering enhances the image quality of textures on surfaces that are at oblique viewing angles. A higher anisotropic level means better texture quality at such angles. For more information, refer to the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-anisoLevel.html).

    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    type: number
  - name: mipMapBias
    summary: |
      The 'mipMapBias' property is used to adjust the mipmap level. Mipmaps are used to enhance the visual quality and rendering speed of scaled textures. This property allows for fine control over the use of mipmaps in your textures. The [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-mipMapBias.html) provides further information.

    code_samples:
    type: number
  - name: texelSize
    summary: |
      The 'texelSize' property gives the size of a single texel (texture element). It represents the world space size of a single pixel of the texture. The [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-texelSize.html) has more detailed information.

    code_samples:
    type: DataType.Vector2
  - name: updateCount
    summary: |
      The 'updateCount' property shows how many times the texture has been updated since the scene was loaded. This can be used for debugging or profiling, to monitor how often a texture is updated. Refer to [Unity's official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-updateCount.html) for more details.

    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    type: number
  - name: isDataSRGB
    summary: |
      The 'isDataSRGB' property determines whether the texture data is in gamma space (sRGB) or not. Gamma space is used to correct lighting calculations in computer graphics. True if the data is sRGB, false if linear. Learn more from the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-isDataSRGB.html).

methods:
  - name: IncrementUpdateCount
    summary: |
      The 'IncrementUpdateCount' method increments the number of times the texture has been updated. Although this method is rarely used for scripting in Unity, it can be useful for advanced texture manipulation such as writing plugins or extensions. Check the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.IncrementUpdateCount.html) for additional details.
