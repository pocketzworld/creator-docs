summary: |
  Think of a Class.GameObject in Unity as an empty box. On its own, it can't do much. However, once you add Components to it, the GameObject becomes lively and capable of interacting with the virtual world you're building. Components are the essence of a GameObject, molding its characteristics and behaviors. They are the DNA of a GameObject, shaping how it interacts within the game environment.

  There's a wide variety of Components that factor into different functionalities. For instance, physical components like Class.Collider that allow GameObjects to physically interact with the environment or other GameObjects. Rendering components such as Class.MeshRenderer and Class.Camera are vital as they provide your GameObject form and control how the player views the game world.

  Adding a Lua script to your GameObject makes it a Component known as a Class.LuaBehaviour. These scripts offer immense creativity, enabling your GameObject to behave in unique ways, from playing animations to responding to inputs or interacting with other GameObjects.

  In summary, Components convert static GameObjects into interactive, dynamic game elements. They're the cornerstone of Unity project development, making your game world immersive and engaging. For a deeper understanding, check out the [official Unity documentation on Components](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.html).

properties:
  - name: transform
    summary: |
      The 'transform' property gives you a handle to the Transform component of the GameObject to which this component is attached. The Transform component controls the position, rotation, and scale of a GameObject in the scene. Check out the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component-transform.html) for more information.

    summary: |
      The 'gameObject' property allows you to access the GameObject that this component is attached to. Many operations in Unity involve manipulating GameObjects, often via the components attached to them. For more details, refer to the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component-gameObject.html).

    type: Class.GameObject
  - name: tag
    summary: |
      The 'tag' property gives you access to the tag of the GameObject this component is attached to. A GameObject can be tagged with a label allowing it to be easily identified and selected within the development environment. For more information, see the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component-tag.html).

    type: string
methods:
  - name: GetComponent
    summary: |
      The 'GetComponent' method is used to retrieve a component of a specified type, if it exists, from the GameObject to which this component is attached. For example, if your GameObject has a Rigidbody component attached, you can retrieve it using this method. Refer to the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.GetComponent.html) for more details.

    code_samples:
    parameters:
      - name: type
        type: Class.Type
        default:
        summary: The type of component to retrieve.
    returns:
      - type: Class.Component
        summary: Returns the requested component if it exists on the GameObject.
  - name: GetComponentInChildren
    summary: |
      The 'GetComponentInChildren' method retrieves the specified component type from the first child of the GameObject this component is attached to. This is useful when you need to manipulate a specific component present in one of the GameObject's child objects. More details can be found in the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.GetComponentInChildren.html).

    code_samples:
    parameters:
      - name: t
        type: Class.Type
        default:
        summary: The type of component to retrieve from child GameObjects.
      - name: includeInactive
        type: boolean
        default:
        summary: If set to true, this method will also search within inactive GameObjects.
    returns:
      - type: Class.Component
        summary: Returns the requested component from child GameObjects if it exists.
  - name: GetComponentInParent
    summary: |
      The 'GetComponentInParent' method works similarly to 'GetComponentInChildren', but instead of searching for the component in children of the GameObject, it looks for it in the parents of the GameObject. For more information, check out the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.GetComponentInParent.html).

    parameters:
      - name: t
        type: Class.Type

        summary: The type of component to retrieve from parent GameObjects.
      - name: includeInactive
        type: boolean
        default:
        summary: If true, this method will also search within inactive GameObjects.
    returns:
      - type: Class.Component
        summary: Returns the requested component from parent GameObjects if it exists.
  - name: CompareTag
    summary: |
      The 'CompareTag' method is useful for comparing if the GameObject's tag matches a specified string. It can be used to differentiate behavior among different groups of GameObjects or implement specific logic based on tags. For more information, refer to the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.CompareTag.html).

    returns:
      - type: boolean
        summary: Returns true if the GameObject's tag matches the specified string, false otherwise.
