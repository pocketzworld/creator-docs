name: Animator
type: classes
summary: |
  The Animator class is responsible for controlling animation in Unity. It interfaces with the animator controller, which is a state machine handling the transitions and interactions between animations, to drive the animated behavior of GameObjects. The Animator class allows you to create, play, manipulate animations and more. For a comprehensive understanding, go through the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animator.html).
