name: Plane
type: datatypes
summary: |
  The Plane data type in Unity represents a plane in 3D space, defined by its normal (a Vector3 representing the direction perpendicular to the plane surface) and its distance from the origin along this normal. 

  Utility of Plane includes geometric computations like calculating intersection points between a line (or ray) and a plane, determining which side of a plane a point is on, or the closest point on the plane to another point in space. 

  This data type is crucial in 3D graphics and physics simulations, serving as a useful tool in many game development scenarios like collision detection, lighting systems, reflection, and more.

constructors:
  - name: new
    summary: |
      The 'new' constructor lets you create a new plane given a normal and a point in 3D space. The normal specifies the plane's orientation, while the point specifies its distance from the origin. The result is a versatile geometric construct used in many algorithms and calculations. More details can be found in the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Plane-ctor.html).

properties:
  - name: normal
    summary: |
      The 'normal' property represents the perpendicular direction to the plane's surface (its orientation). This Vector3 normal is unit length and can be used to calculate the orientation of angled surfaces or the angle between two intersecting planes. See the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Plane-normal.html) for more information.

  - name: distance
    summary: |
      The 'distance' property gives the shortest distance between the plane and the origin, along the plane's normal. This value is often used for computations involving the plane and other 3D objects. Please refer to [Unity's Plane.distance Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Plane-distance.html) for further specifics.

    type: number
  - name: flipped
    summary: |
      The 'flipped' property returns a new plane that is identical to this one, but with the normal vector flipped to point in the opposite direction. This altered plane essentially represents the same geometric plane in 3D space but with its front and back sides swapped.

methods:
  - name: Raycast
    summary: |
      The 'Raycast' method determines if a ray intersects the plane, and if so, how far along the ray the intersection point occurs. This is a commonly performed operation in 3D graphics, useful for scenarios like mouse picking, where you want to determine what object in the 3D world the user has clicked on. See [Unity's Plane.Raycast Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Plane.Raycast.html) for more details.

        default:
        summary: The ray to test for intersection.
    returns:
      - type: (boolean, number)
        summary: A tuple containing a boolean that indicates whether the ray intersected the Plane and the distance at which it intersected.
  - name: SetNormalAndPosition
    summary: |
      The 'SetNormalAndPosition' method allows you to alter the plane's normal vector and adjust its position directly, redefining the plane in 3D space. This can be useful when the orientation or position of an existing Plane needs to be adjusted. More information is available in [Unity's Plane.SetNormalAndPosition Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Plane.SetNormalAndPosition.html).

        summary:
  - name: Set3Points
    summary: |
      The 'Set3Points' method recalculates the plane to contain the three specified points. You can consider this as stretching or reshaping the plane to pass through the provided three points in space. This can prove useful when a plane needs to wrap around a newly defined area in space. More context can be found in [Unity's Plane.Set3Points Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Plane.Set3Points.html).

      - type: void
        summary:
  - name: Flip
    summary: |
      The 'Flip' method flips the plane's normal to point in the opposite direction. This changes which side of the plane is considered the "front". If you have a one-sided surface and want to make it face the other way without moving the plane, 'Flip' can be useful. Check out [Unity's Plane.Flip Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Plane.Flip.html) for a better understanding.

      The 'Translate' method moves the plane in 3D space by an offset specified by a Vector3. If you have a defined plane and you want to shift it in space without changing its orientation, this method is a good choice. You can learn more in [Unity's Plane.Translate Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Plane.Translate.html).
