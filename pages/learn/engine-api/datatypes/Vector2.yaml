name: Vector2
type: datatypes
summary: |
  The 'Vector2' data type in Unity represents a two dimensional vector – a quantity that has both magnitude (or length) and direction, but in 2D Space. It is commonly used for representing positions, velocities, and directions in a two-dimensional space such as a game screen or 2D physics simulation. For in-depth understanding, you can check the [official Unity documentation for Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html).

      The 'Scale' method lets you scale the Vector2 by another Vector2's components. This means 'x' components will multiply each other, as well will the 'y' components. For example, if you're scaling Vector2(2, 3) by Vector2(2, 2), the resultant Vector2 will be Vector2(4, 6). To know more, see the [official Unity Vector2.Scale documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.Scale.html).

      The 'Normalize' method changes the Vector2 into a direction vector - it maintains its direction but its length becomes 1. This proves useful when the direction of a vector is important but not its length. For a deeper understanding, refer to the [official Unity Vector2.Normalize Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.Normalize.html).

      The 'SqrMagnitude' method provides the square of the magnitude (length) of the Vector2. Much like the 'sqrMagnitude' property, it's a performance-friendly way of comparing lengths because it skips the computationally expensive square root operation. More information can be found in the [official Unity Vector2.SqrMagnitude documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.SqrMagnitude.html).

    summary: |
      The 'Lerp' method does a Linear Interpolation between two Vector2's based on a 't' parameter and returns a new interpolated Vector2. When 't' is 0, it returns 'a'. If 't' is 1, it returns 'b'. At any other 't' value, it gives a point along the line between 'a' and 'b'.

    summary: |
      The 'LerpUnclamped' method does a Linear Interpolation between two Vector2's like 'Lerp', but unlike 'Lerp', it doesn't clamp the 't' parameter between 0 and 1. So, the resultant Vector2 can be before 'a' or after 'b'. To understand more, see [Unity's Vector2.LerpUnclamped documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.LerpUnclamped.html).

  - operation: '/'
    summary: |
      The '/' operator allows you to divide each component of a Vector2 by a number. So, if you divide Vector2(4, 6) by 2, the result will be Vector2(2, 3). More details can be found in the [official Unity Vector2.operator_divide documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-operator_divide.html).

    code_samples:
  - operation: '*'
    summary: |
      The '*' operator lets you multiply a number and a Vector2. It returns a new Vector2 where each component of the original Vector2 has been multiplied by the number. For example, 2 * Vector2(2, 3) results in Vector2(4, 6). More info can be found in the [official Unity Vector2.operator_multiply documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-operator_multiply.html).

    type_b: Vector2
    return_type: Vector2
    code_samples:
  - operation: '-'
    summary: |
      The '-' operator applied to one Vector2 simply negates the 'x' and 'y' components of the Vector2. So, if you have a Vector2(2, 3), applying '-' would result in Vector2(-2, -3). This operation can be helpful in flipping the direction of a Vector2.

    type_a: Vector2
    type_b:
    return_type: Vector2
    code_samples:
  - operation: '-'
    summary: |
      The '-' operator can be used between two Vector2's to subtract the second one from the first one component-wise. So, Vector2(4, 6) - Vector2(2, 3) will yield Vector2(2, 3). This operation is often used to find the relative Vector2 from one position to another. More details can be found in the [official Unity Vector2.operator_subtract documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-operator_subtract.html).

    type_a: Vector2
    type_b: Vector2
    return_type: Vector2
    code_samples:
  - operation: '+'
    summary: |
      The '+' operator adds two Vector2's together, component-wise. Hence if you're adding Vector2(2, 3) and Vector2(4, 6), the resultant Vector2 will be Vector2(6, 9). This operation is often used for combining offsets or changes. For its usage and further details, you can check the [official Unity Vector2.operator_add documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-operator_add.html).
