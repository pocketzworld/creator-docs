summary: |
  In Lua scripting, Globals are essential values or variables that can be accessed from any part of the script without the need to pass them explicitly. They are context-specific and readily available. On the other hand, a Service in Lua script is like a toolbox of static functions that offer convenient utilities for developers to use in their scripts.

    summary: |
      The 'self' property is used to access the object's instance. This is always the owning script of the object as a Class.LuaBehaviour. This is the primary way to get many of the core Unity MonoBehaviour methods and properties like `self.gameObject`, `self.Update` and `self.OnTriggerEnter`. It is highly recommended to familiarize yourself with the Class.LuaBehaviour documentation to understand how to use the 'self' property.

  - name: client
    summary: |
      The 'client' property is used to access the current client instance. This is useful for when you want to access the client's information like the `client.localPlayer` property or `client.PlayerConnected` event. Read the Class.GameClient documentation to learn more.
