name: AudioShader
type: classes
summary: Provides functionality for audio manipulation and playback, including volume and pitch adjustments, spatial considerations, and muting capabilities.

description: The AudioShader class is a comprehensive solution for managing audio within game scenes. It allows developers to control various aspects of audio playback, such as muting, volume level, pitch adjustments, and spatial audio effects. This class supports dynamic audio experiences by offering properties for random volume and pitch variations, thus enabling more immersive and varied audio effects in games. Inherits from `Class.Object`, providing a base for audio-related functionalities in a game engine similar to Unity or Roblox.

properties:
  - name: IsMuted
    summary: Indicates whether the audio is currently muted.
    description: This property allows developers to check or set the muted state of the audio. When set to `true`, the audio will not play.
    is_static: false

    type: boolean
  - name: SpatialRange
    summary: Defines the range in which the audio can be heard.
    description: This property sets the maximum distance at which the audio is audible. Beyond this range, the audio volume decreases to silence, simulating spatial audio effects.
    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    type: number
  - name: volume
    summary: Controls the playback volume of the audio.
    description: This property allows for adjusting the volume level of the audio. The value ranges from 0 (silent) to 1 (maximum volume).
    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    type: number
  - name: randomVolume
    summary: Sets a range for random volume variation.
    description: This property enables random variation in volume within the specified range, adding dynamic changes to the audio playback volume.
    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    type: number
  - name: pitch
    summary: Adjusts the pitch of the audio playback.
    description: This property allows for changing the pitch of the audio, with higher values increasing the pitch and lower values decreasing it.
    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    type: number
  - name: randomPitch
    summary: Sets a range for random pitch variation.
    description: This property allows for random variation in pitch within a specified range, making the audio playback more dynamic and varied.
    is_static: false

    type: number
methods:
  - name: Play
    summary: Begins playback of the audio with optional volume and pitch parameters.
    description: This method starts the audio playback. Developers can optionally specify volume and pitch to customize the playback for this instance.
    is_static: false

    parameters:
      - name: volume
        type: number
        default:
        summary: The volume at which to play the audio. Overrides the instance's volume property for this playback.
      - name: pitch
        type: number
        default:
        summary: The pitch at which to play the audio. Overrides the instance's pitch property for this playback.
    returns:
      - type: void
        summary: This method does not return a value.
  - name: GetRandomClip
    summary: Returns a randomly selected AudioClip from the available set.
    description: This method selects and returns a random AudioClip object, allowing for varied audio playback without manually selecting clips.
    is_static: false
