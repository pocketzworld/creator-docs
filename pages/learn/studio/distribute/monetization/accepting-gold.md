# Accepting Gold Payments

## Introduction

Highrise enables World Creators to accept Gold payments within their worlds. Gold is a virtual currency that players can use in game or cash out for real money. Creators can make their worlds more engaging by offering exclusive items, access to special areas, or other benefits in exchange for Gold.

## Revenue Share

Creators earn 70% of the Gold they collect. This is deposited directly into their [Creator Exchange](https://create.highrise.game/dashboard/finances/creator-exchange) as Earned Gold. The Highrise platform keeps 30% of the fee in order to pay for app store transaction fees, hosting fees, and continued platform development.

## How Accepting Gold Payments Works

You can accept Gold payments in your world by using the Highrise Payments API. The API provides functions that allow you to prompt players to make a purchase, handle the purchase on the server, and acknowledge the purchase.

<Note type="warning">
For the Payment API to work, you need to create a product in the Creator Portal.
