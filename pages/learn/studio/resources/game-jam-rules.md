# Game Jam Rules

Game Jams are curated creative events designed to support Highrise’s most dedicated creators in building rich, polished, and memorable worlds. Each Game Jam features a structured theme, clear technical expectations, and meaningful rewards focused on quality, originality, and collaboration.
