# Game Jam Rules

Game Jams are creative events designed to help creators build richer, higher quality, and longer lasting worlds. Each event features a structured theme, clear requirements, and rewards for the best submissions. The program supports both new and experienced creators while maintaining fairness, originality, and consistent quality standards.

Below are the official rules for participating in any Highrise Game Jam.

* Updated worlds must remove the **previous Game Jam tag** and apply the **current Game Jam tag**.
* Updated worlds must include new work aligned with the current theme.
* Submissions must include the official Game Jam tag listed in the announcement. Tags are entered without the `#` symbol.
* Selling, purchasing, or submitting someone else’s world is strictly prohibited.
* Worlds must follow the two part theme:
  * **Visual theme**
  * **Gameplay mechanic**
* Template based, low effort, or incomplete worlds will not be accepted.
