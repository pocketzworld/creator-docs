# Payments

## Introduction

[Payments](/learn/studio-api/services/Payments) are a crucial part of many games and experiences, allowing players to purchase in-game items, unlock content, and support developers. In this guide, you'll learn how to implement payments in your Highrise Studio projects using the Highrise Payments API.

World owner cannot purchase their own IWPs. You will need to use a different account to test the purchase flow in the app.
</Note>

## Setting Up Payments

### Step 1: Create In-World Purchases
1. Go to the [Creator Portal](https://create.highrise.game/)
2. Select the world you want to create a product for
3. Navigate to the **In-World Purchases** section under the **Monetization** tab
4. Click on the **Create** button
5. Fill in the product details, such as the product ID, name, description
6. Click on the **Create** button to create the product

<Note type="warning">
In-World Purchases (IWP) product ID is a unique string that identifies the product. It is used to reference the product in your scripts.
</Note>

<Note type="warning">
Highrise will take 30% of the revenue generated from the sale of In-World Purchases (IWP). The remaining 70% will be credited to your account.
</Note>

### Step 2: Creating a Payment Handler (Optional)
1. Right-click in the project panel and select `Create > Lua > Module`
2. Give your module a name, such as `PaymentHandlerScript`
3. Right-click in the Hierarchy panel and select `Create Empty`
4. Give the empty object a name, such as `PaymentHandler`
5. Drag the `PaymentHandlerScript` module onto the `PaymentHandler` object
6. Open the `PaymentHandlerScript` module and follow Step 3 below

### Step 3: Implementing the Payment Handler
<Note type="warning">
All payment-related scripts are done on the server side. Do not use payment-related functions on the client side.
</Note>

```lua
--!Type(Module)

--[[
  In this example we will be using "tokens" as the currency
  This is currently stored locally, but you should store it in Storage or Inventory for persistence
]]

-- Keep track of the players and their tokens
local tokens = 0 -- Please use Storage or Inventory instead (this is just an example)

-- Function to Prompt the player to purchase a token (Client Side)
function PromptTokenPurchase(id: string)
  Payments:PromptPurchase(id, function(paid)
    if paid then
      print("Purchase successful")
    else
      print("Purchase failed")
    end
  end)
end

-- Function to increment the player's tokens (Server Side)
function IncrementTokens(player: Player, amount: number)
  -- Note: Remember to add your own logic if you are using Network values or Storage
  -- In this case we are only storing the tokens locally (not recommended but for example purposes)
  tokens = tokens + amount

  -- Print the player's name, the amount of tokens they received, and their total tokens
  print(player.name .. " received " .. amount .. " tokens. Total tokens: " .. tokens)
end

-- Function to handle the purchase (Server Side)
function ServerHandlePurchase(purchase, player: Player)
  -- Note: The product ID is a string even when it represents a number
  local productId = purchase.product_id -- The product ID that was purchased (e.g., "token")

  -- The amount of tokens to give the player
  local tokensToGive = 0 -- Initialize the amount of tokens to give

  -- Assuming you have multiple products to purchase (e.g., "token_100", "token_500")
  if productId == "token_100" then
    tokensToGive = 100
  elseif productId == "token_500" then
    tokensToGive = 500
  else
    -- No product found, reject the purchase and return
    Payments.AcknowledgePurchase(purchase, false)
    -- Add an extra message to the console to help with debugging
    print("Unknown product ID: " .. productId)
    return
  end

  -- The purchase was successful, acknowledge the purchase and give the player the tokens
  Payments.AcknowledgePurchase(purchase, true, function(ackErr: PaymentsError)
    -- Check for any errors when acknowledging the purchase
    if ackErr ~= PaymentsError.None then
      print("Error acknowledging purchase: " .. ackErr)
      return
    end

    -- Add the tokens to the player's account (calling the IncrementTokens function)
    IncrementTokens(player, tokensToGive)
  end)
end

-- Initialize the module
function self:ServerAwake()
  -- IMPORTANT: Register the ServerHandlePurchase function as the callback for the PurchaseHandler
  Payments.PurchaseHandler = ServerHandlePurchase
end
```

### Step 4: Calling the Payment Handler
```lua
--!Type(UI)

-- Now assuming the module script is named PaymentHandlerScript
local PaymentHandler = require("PaymentHandlerScript")

-- Assuming you have a button called PurchaseButton
--!Bind
local PurchaseButton : UIButton = nil

-- Register the callback for the button press
PurchaseButton:RegisterPressCallback(function()
  -- Call the PromptTokenPurchase function when the button is clicked
  PaymentHandler.PromptTokenPurchase("token_100")
end, true, true, true)
```

### Step 5: Testing the Payment Handler

1. In the Unity Editor select `Highrise > World Settings`
2. Under the **World** tab, set the **World** to the world you created the product for
3. This will allow you to test the payment handler in the Unity Editor

## Summary of Functions

### Prompting the Player to Purchase
When you want to prompt the player to purchase an item, you can call the `PromptPurchase` function and pass the product
ID and a callback function.

```lua
-- Prompt the player to purchase a token
Payments.PromptPurchase("token_100", function(paid: boolean)
  if paid then
    print("Purchase successful")
  else
    print("Purchase failed")
  end
end)
```

### Handling the Purchase
When a player makes a purchase, you need to handle the purchase on the server side. You can call the `ServerHandlePurchase` function and pass the purchase object and the player object.

```lua
-- Handle the purchase
PaymentHandler.ServerHandlePurchase(purchase, player)
```

### Acknowledging Purchases
When a player makes a purchase, you need to acknowledge the purchase to complete the transaction. You can acknowledge a purchase by calling the `AcknowledgePurchase` function and passing the purchase object, a boolean value indicating whether the purchase was successful, and an optional callback function.

```lua
-- Acknowledge the purchase
Payments.AcknowledgePurchase(purchase, true, function(ackErr: PaymentsError)
  -- Check for any errors when acknowledging the purchase
  if ackErr ~= PaymentsError.None then
    print("Error acknowledging purchase: " .. ackErr)
    return
  end

  -- Add the tokens to the player's account (calling the IncrementTokens function)
  IncrementTokens(player, tokensToGive)
end)
```

### Rejecting Purchases

If the purchase fails or if the product ID is unknown, you can reject the purchase by calling the `AcknowledgePurchase` function and passing the purchase object and a boolean value indicating that the purchase failed.

```lua
-- Reject the purchase
Payments.AcknowledgePurchase(purchase, false)
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to implement payments in your Highrise Studio projects using the Highrise Payments API. By following the examples provided, you can create In-World Purchases (IWP), handle purchases, and acknowledge or reject purchases in your project. Implementing payments in your project can help you monetize your game or experience and provide players with a way to support your work.
