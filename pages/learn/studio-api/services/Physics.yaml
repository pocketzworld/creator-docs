name: Physics
type: classes
summary: |
  The Physics class is a central part of Unity's physics engine, responsible for various global physical simulations in your Scene. Whether it's simulating gravity, handling collisions, or detecting the interplay between GameObjects, the Physics class plays a significant role. It also provides information and controls over global settings such as gravity and layer collision settings.

  Imagine you're playing a game of pool. In this scenario, the Physics class serves as the invisible hand that defines the direction and speed of balls when hit, determines when collisions occur, and decides how balls should bounce off each other or the pool table edges.

  This is your one stop shop for controlling and getting information about the physics simulation. For more information, explore the details in [Unity's Physics Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.html).

  - name: gravity
    summary: |
      The 'gravity' property gives you control over the global gravity applied in the physics simulation. By default, it acts downward with a force of 9.8 m/s squared, much like gravity on Earth. Dive deeper into [Unity's Physics.gravity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics-gravity.html) to understand its impact.
