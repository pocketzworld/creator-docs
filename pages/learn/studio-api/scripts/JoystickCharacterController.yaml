name: JoystickCharacterController
type: scripts
summary: |
  JoystickCharacterController is a built-in component that replaces PlayerCharacterController to enable on-screen joystick-based character movement.
  This controller provides touch-based controls with an on-screen joystick for moving characters in your world.
  IMPORTANT: This is a replacement for PlayerCharacterController, not an addition. You must remove PlayerCharacterController when using this controller.
  NOTE: Joystick is still in beta and may have some limitations. It does not currently support multi-touch input or the Anchor property.
  
  To add JoystickCharacterController to your world:
  1. In the project view, right-click and select Create > Highrise > World Scene variant
  2. Rename the scene variant (e.g., "JoystickScenePrefab")
  3. In the scene variant, add the JoystickCharacterController component
  4. Remove the default PlayerCharacterController component
  5. Customize the Joystick properties in the inspector
  6. Click "Use this prefab" to set it as the default scene variant
  
  Configurable Properties (via Unity Inspector):
  Basic Properties:
  - Footstep Walk Sound: Sound played when character is walking
  - Footstep Run Sound: Sound played when character is running
  - External Input Action: External input action for keyboards/gamepads (recommended: "Movement/Movement")
  - Running Speed Threshold: Speed at which character switches from walking to running
  - Is 2D: Uses XY coordinates of joystick as XY world coordinates (useful for 2D games)
  
  Advanced Properties:
  - Max Link Distance: Maximum in-world distance between character and link endpoint
  - Max Line Angle: Angle between movement direction and link's jump direction
  - Max Link Move Step Change: Difference proportion between desired movement and actual nav mesh movement
  
  Considerations:
  - Performance: Joystick controllers can be more performance-intensive due to continuous input processing
  - Camera Movement: Ensure your camera follows the character (default RTS camera is compatible)
  - Customization: Adjust properties to fit your game's needs
  - Feedback: Provide visual and audio feedback for movement and actions
