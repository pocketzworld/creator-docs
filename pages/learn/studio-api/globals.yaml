      The 'self' property is used to access the object's instance. This is always the owning script of the object as a Class.LuaBehaviour. This is the primary way to get many of the core Unity MonoBehaviour methods and properties like `self.gameObject`, `self.Update` and `self.OnTriggerEnter`. It is highly recommended to familiarize yourself with the Class.LuaBehaviour documentation to understand how to use the 'self' property.
