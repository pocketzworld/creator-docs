name: Ray
type: datatypes
summary: |
  Represents a line in 3D space extending indefinitely from a source point (origin) in a specified direction. It is utilized extensively for ray casting and collision detection.

    summary: |
      Creates a new Ray instance with specified origin and direction vectors. If the direction vector's magnitude is not 1, it's normalized. The origin and direction vectors are stored in the Ray instance.
