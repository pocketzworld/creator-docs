name: Bounds
type: datatypes
summary: |
  An axis-aligned bounding box. It acts as a simple container for a center position and the extents (further subdivided into size, min, max) of a box that can be used for collision detection, visibility testing, or other similar tasks in your game.

  - name: extents
    summary: |
      Similar to size but it represents half the size of the bounding box in each dimension. This can be used when you need to measure from the center of the bounding box.

        summary:
  - name: Encapsulate
    summary: |
      Grows the Bounds to include a point or bounds. You would typically use this when you have a set of points and you want a bounding box that encloses all these points.

    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    parameters:
      - name: point
        type: DataType.Vector3
        default:
        summary: The new point to include within the bounding box.
    returns:
      - type: void
        summary:
  - name: Expand
    summary: |
      Increases the size of the bounding box by the given amount (in both directions).
    description:
    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    parameters:
      - name: amount
        type: number
        default:
        summary: The amount by which the bounding box should be expanded (shrank if negative).

      - type: void
        summary:
  - name: Intersects
    summary: |
      Checks whether the current bounding box intersects with another bounding box. You can use this to determine if two objects are likely to be colliding.
    description:
    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    parameters:
      - name: bounds
        type: DataType.Bounds
        default:
        summary: The other bounding box to test intersection with.
    returns:
      - type: boolean
        summary: Returns true if the bounding boxes intersect, false otherwise.
  - name: IntersectRay
    summary: |
      Determines if a specified Ray intersects the bounds. This can prove vital in various game scenarios for interaction detection such as determining if a projectile is in range of an object or if a click or tap in screen space intersects a game object. It evaluates the intersection and returns true if the Ray intersects with the bounds, otherwise it returns false.

        summary: Returns true if the point is inside the bounding box, false otherwise.
  - name: SqrDistance
    summary: |
      Returns the squared distance from a point to the bounding box. Squared distances can be useful for comparison without needing the computationally expensive square root operation.

      - type: number
        summary: Returns the squared distance from the bounding box to the point.
  - name: ClosestPoint
