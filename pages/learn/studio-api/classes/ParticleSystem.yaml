name: ParticleSystem
type: classes
summary: |
  The ParticleSystem class in Unity allows you to create visually complex and dynamic simulations like fire, smoke, or a flock of birds. From sparks flying in a firefight to the delicate dust particles in a sunbeam, particle systems bring a game to life.
  
  At its core, a ParticleSystem shoots out particles in a certain direction and for a certain duration, but there's much more to it than that. You can control over a wide range of properties like the color, size, and shape of the particles, the speed and direction of their emission, and their behavior over their lifetime.
  
  Want to have physics applied to your particles or intricate collisions? That's possible too. Given its scalability and rich feature set, ParticleSystem is a powerful tool for adding atmospheric and stylistic flair to your game.
  
  To understand how to use ParticleSystem to its full potential, refer to [Unity's ParticleSystem Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.html).
