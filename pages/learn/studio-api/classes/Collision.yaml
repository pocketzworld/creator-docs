name: Collision
type: classes
summary: |
  Collision encapsulates details about interactions between moving objects, including the collision's impact, the objects involved, and the exact collision points. It offers a suite of properties that provide insights into the physical dynamics of a collision, aiding in the application of game logic and physics manipulations during collision events. The Collision class is pivotal for handling "OnCollision" events, offering a detailed framework for understanding and reacting to in-game physical interactions. Refer to Unity's official Collision documentation for a deeper exploration.
