name: BoolValue
type: classes
summary: BoolValue class stores a single boolean value, extending from Class.Value. It's designed for synchronizing a boolean value across all clients in a networked environment, ensuring consistency of a specific flag or state, such as a game over condition. To effectively utilize BoolValue, familiarity with the base Class.Value documentation is advised.
