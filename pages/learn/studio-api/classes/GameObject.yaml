name: GameObject
type: classes
summary: |
  In Unity, a GameObject refers to an object existing in your game's world -- everything from characters, buildings, landscapes, to lights, cameras, and more can be GameObjects. It acts as encompassing container or entity that could carry multiple types of components that dictate how this GameObject behaves and interacts in your game.
  
  A GameObject can be as simple as a single point of light in a dark room or as complex as a character with AI-driven behaviors, interactive elements, physical properties, etc. It just depends on what kind of components you attach to it. Examples of components include scripts (pieces of code that dictate GameObject behavior), physics components like Rigidbodies or Colliders, audio sources, and much more.
  
  Understanding GameObjects is vital to building anything in Unity, as they comprise the functional elements of all scenes, mechanics, and interactions within the game engine. For more extensive understanding, consider perusing the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html).
