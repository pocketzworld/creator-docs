name: CapsuleCollider
type: classes
summary: |
  CapsuleCollider is a collider component in Unity shaped like a capsule, suitable for elongated spherical objects where SphereCollider and BoxCollider aren't ideal fits. It detects collisions between GameObjects, allowing scripted reactions to these events. CapsuleColliders can be resized and repositioned to match GameObject shapes accurately.
