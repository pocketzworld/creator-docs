name: GameClient
type: classes
summary: |
  The global `client` object provides access to client-side game context and is available in Client and ClientAndServer scripts.
  Inherits from Game, so all Game properties (Players, Info, PlayerCount, etc.) are also available.
  
  Use cases:
  - Accessing the local player (the player running this client)
  - Responding to player connections and disconnections from the client's perspective
  - Client-specific UI updates and interactions
  - Managing local player state and input
  
  Availability:
  - Client scripts: `client` is always available
  - ClientAndServer scripts: Check if `client ~= nil` or `server == nil` to determine if running on client
  
  Example usage:

  function self:ClientStart()
      -- Access local player
      local myPlayer = client.localPlayer
      print("I am: " .. myPlayer.name)
  
      -- RECOMMENDED: Use scene.players for players in current scene
      print("Players in this scene: " .. scene.playerCount)
  
      -- Use client.players for all players across all scenes
      print("Total players in world: " .. client.playerCount)
      print("Room ID: " .. client.info.roomId)
  end
  
  function self:Start()
      -- Check if running on client or server
      if client ~= nil then
          print("Running on client")
          print("Local player: " .. client.localPlayer.name)
      elseif server ~= nil then
          print("Running on server")
