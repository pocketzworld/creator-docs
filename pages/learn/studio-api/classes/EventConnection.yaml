summary: |
  EventConnection manages the connection between an event and its callback function.
  Returned when calling Event:Connect(), allowing you to later disconnect the callback.
  
  Use EventConnection to:
  - Stop listening to events when no longer needed
  - Clean up connections to prevent memory leaks
  - Conditionally enable/disable event handlers
