summary: |
  AudioListener functions as the game's auditory receiver, essential for creating immersive audio experiences. It works in tandem with AudioSource objects, replicating the real-world effect of sound proximity and volume. Typically attached to the camera or player, it facilitates global audio control, including volume adjustment and scene-wide pausing. For in-depth insights, consult Unity's official AudioListener documentation.
