name: Collider
type: classes
summary: Collider acts as an invisible force field around GameObjects, essential for interactions like collisions and input responses. Integrating with Rigidbody, Colliders allow objects to engage physically with the game world, simulating real-world physics. Various Collider types match different object shapes, enabling precise interaction management. Colliders can be set as triggers for event detection without physical response, offering versatility in gameplay mechanics. Refer to the official Unity Collider documentation for in-depth guidance.
