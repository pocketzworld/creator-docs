name: Component
type: classes
summary: Component acts as the core of GameObject customization, enabling GameObjects to exhibit specific characteristics and behaviors. It's the foundation for a wide range of functionalities, from physics interactions with Collider to visual presentations via MeshRenderer and Camera components. Components transform GameObjects from static entities to dynamic actors within the game world. Scripting through LuaBehaviour further expands potential behaviors, allowing for unique game mechanics and interactions. Components are pivotal for developing immersive, interactive game environments. Explore Unity's Component documentation for detailed insights.
