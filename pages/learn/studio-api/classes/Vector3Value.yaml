name: Vector3Value
type: classes
summary: |
  The Vector3Value class is used to store a single Datatype.Vector3 value. It is a subclass of the Class.Value and it is recommended to check out that documentation before continuing on. This class is useful for tracking a single integer value that all clients should be synchronized on.

  #### Synchronizing a Vector3
  description: This example demonstrates how to use an Vector3Value to synchronize a position across all clients.
  ```lua
    local objectivePosition : Vector3Value = Vector3Value.new("objectivePosition", Vector3.new(0,0,0))
    local onNewObjPos : Event = Event.new("onNewObjPos")

    -- not local so that another script can find this one and call this function
    function GetNewObjPos()
      onNewObjPos:FireServer()
    end

    local function Client()
      objectivePosition.Changed:Connect(function()
          print("The score is now " .. objectivePosition.value)
      end)
    end

    local function Server()
      onNewObjPos:Connect(function()
          objectivePosition.value = Vector3.new(1,2,3) -- your logic here
      end)
    end

    if server then
      Server()
    else
      Client()
    end
  ```

      The currently synchronized Vector3 value of the Vector3Value. This is the value that all clients will be synchronized on and if changed, notified that the value is now different from the Value.Changed event.
