name: Game
type: classes
summary: |
  The global `game` object provides access to core game state and information available on both client and server.
  This is the base class for both `client` (GameClient) and `server` (GameServer) objects.
  
  Use cases:
  - Accessing all connected players in the world
  - Getting world instance information (room ID, creator, privacy settings, etc.)
  - Checking if running in Unity Editor
  - Retrieving networked GameObjects by their network ID
  
  Available on: Client and Server scripts

  -- Check world instance info
  print("World ID: " .. game.info.worldId)
  print("Max Players: " .. game.info.maxPlayers)
  print("Is Private: " .. tostring(game.info.isPrivate))
  
  -- Get player count
  print("Connected players: " .. game.playerCount)

  - name: playerCount
    summary: |
      The total number of players connected to the world instance (across all scenes).
      Equivalent to `#game.players`.
      
      IMPORTANT: In most cases, you should use `scene.playerCount` instead.
      - `game.playerCount` returns total players across all scenes
      - `scene.playerCount` returns only players in a specific scene (recommended)

      if game.playerCount >= game.info.maxPlayers then

    summary: |
      An array of all the players currently connected to the world instance (across all scenes).
      
      IMPORTANT: In most cases, you should use `scene.players` instead of `game.players`.
      - `game.players` returns ALL players in the entire world instance
      - `scene.players` returns only players in a specific scene (recommended)
      
      Use game.players only when you need to access players across all scenes.

methods:
  - name: GetNetworkObject
    summary: |
      Retrieves a NetworkObjectValue for a GameObject by its network ID.
      Network IDs are used to identify networked GameObjects across clients and servers.
      Use this to access networked GameObjects when you have their network ID (e.g., from a NetworkObjectValue's value, or from another networked reference).
      
      Returns a NetworkObjectValue that can be used to synchronize the GameObject reference across the network.
      Returns nil if the network ID doesn't exist or the object isn't found.
