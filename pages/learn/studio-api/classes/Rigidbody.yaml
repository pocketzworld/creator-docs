name: Rigidbody
type: classes
summary: |
  The Rigidbody component adds physical properties to an object, allowing it to react to forces and torques, making it controlled by the unity physics engine. If you want an object to be affected by gravity, for instance, or if you want to be able to apply forces to it, you would attach a Rigidbody component to it. Rigidbody also keeps track of the object's position and orientation.
  
  One common application of Rigidbodies is for creating objects that move and interact under physics control. On the other hand, you could also use Rigidbody for objects which move kinematically or which you want to move around the world but want to avoid intersection with other Rigidbodies. For a more detailed understanding, refer to the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html).

    summary: |
      The 'isKinematic' property, when enabled, makes the Rigidbody stop responding to forces, effectively turning off its built-in physics engine. The Rigidbody continues to interact with other non-kinematic bodies and collide with them but will move only when directly controlled by its Transform. This is useful when moving objects under direct player or script control.

For example, giving an object a larger mass in the game would make it harder to push around.

    summary: |
      The 'Sleep' method is used to put the Rigidbody to sleep. When a Rigidbody is asleep, it won't register any physics updates until it's woken up, saving processing power. In most cases, you won't need to manually put a Rigidbody to sleep, as Unity does it automatically when objects come to rest. However, there may be times when you need to put a Rigidbody to sleep instantly, for example, when a game object should freeze in place.
