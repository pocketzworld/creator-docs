name: Rigidbody
type: classes
summary: |
  The Rigidbody component adds physical properties to an object, allowing it to react to forces and torques, making it controlled by the unity physics engine. If you want an object to be affected by gravity, for instance, or if you want to be able to apply forces to it, you would attach a Rigidbody component to it. Rigidbody also keeps track of the object's position and orientation. 

  One common application of Rigidbodies is for creating objects that move and interact under physics control. On the other hand, you could also use Rigidbody for objects which move kinematically or which you want to move around the world but want to avoid intersection with other Rigidbodies. For a more detailed understanding, refer to the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html).

  - name: velocity
    summary: |
      The 'velocity' property accesses the velocity of the Rigidbody. It is essentially the speed at which the Rigidbody is moving through 3D space in your game, as measured in units per second, giving you control over the speed at which an object moves. For more about velocity, check out the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-velocity.html).

  - name: angularVelocity
    summary: |
      The 'angularVelocity' property describes the angular velocity vector of the Rigidbody in degrees per second. Angular velocity essentially measures the rate and direction of rotation. When working on rotating objects or adjusting spin on Rigidbodies this becomes very handy. Refer to the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-angularVelocity.html) for more.

  - name: drag
    summary: |
      The 'drag' property gives you control over the drag acting on the Rigidbody. Drag is a force that reduces the velocity of the Rigidbody making it decelerate over time as the force increases with speed. The ability to manipulate drag could help in emulating real-world physics like airflow resistance, slowing down your Rigidbody's linear movement over time. To learn more about this, visit the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-drag.html).

  - name: angularDrag
    summary: |
      The 'angularDrag' property controls the angular drag applied to the Rigidbody. Angular drag could be interpreted as your Rigidbody's rotational inertia or in simpler terms, resistance to changes in rotating speed. Modifying this could help in creating more realistic movements and spins. You can explore more in the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-angularDrag.html).

  - name: mass
    summary: |
      The 'mass' property allows you to alter the mass of the Rigidbody. The mass of an object is an important aspect in physics-based interactions and plays a crucial role when calculating how forces affect it. For example, giving an object a larger mass in the game would make it harder to push around. The [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-mass.html) provides more insights about this.

    summary: |
      The 'useGravity' property enables or disables the application of gravity on the Rigidbody. Disabling gravity might be useful for certain objects, like in a zero-gravity setting or while programming specific behaviors for an object, like a hover effect. To find out more, you can check the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-useGravity.html).

    code_samples:
    type: boolean
  - name: maxDepenetrationVelocity
    summary: |
      The 'maxDepenetrationVelocity' property sets the maximum velocity the Rigidbody can have when resolving penetration. It's useful primarily for sleeping bodies that are directly moved or affected by other bodies that initiate overlaps.

    type: number
  - name: isKinematic
    summary: |
      The 'isKinematic' property, when enabled, makes the Rigidbody stop responding to forces, effectively turning off its built-in physics engine. The Rigidbody continues to interact with other non-kinematic bodies and collide with them but will move only when directly controlled by its Transform. This is useful when moving objects under direct player or script control. Please consult the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-isKinematic.html) for more information.

      The 'GetAccumulatedForce' method obtains the force accumulated on the Rigidbody over one physics simulation step. This is useful in certain effects or physics-based calculators that need to understand the amount of force being put on an object. For more details, refer to the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.GetAccumulatedForce.html).

    summary: |
      The 'GetAccumulatedTorque' method retrieves the torque accumulated on the Rigidbody over one physics simulation step. Just like 'GetAccumulatedForce', this method is useful where you need to calculate the rotation effects based on the amount of torque applied on an object. The [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.GetAccumulatedTorque.html) provides additional context for this.

  - name: ClosestPointOnBounds
    summary: |
      The 'ClosestPointOnBounds' method finds the closest point to the provided position on the collider's boundary of the attached Rigidbody. This method can be advantageous in numerous scenarios such as checking how close an object is to touching or hitting something. You can delve deeper into this topic in the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.ClosestPointOnBounds.html).
