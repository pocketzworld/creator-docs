name: Behaviour
type: classes
summary: |
  Behaviour serves as the foundational class for enabling or disabling functionality on GameObjects, acting as a base for various active components such as scripts (MonoBehaviour), physics components (Rigidbody), and renderers (MeshRenderer). It facilitates dynamic control over the active states of attached functionalities. For comprehensive information, the official Unity documentation on Behaviour is recommended.
