name: GameServer
type: classes
summary: |
  In Highrise's scripting environment, the GameServer class acts as the high-level game context the script is running remotely. Any server-level interaction or manipulation will be found in this class. Specifically, scripts marked 'Server' or 'Client and Server' can access server - with 'Client and Server' scripts requiring you to check if `server` is not nil (or `client` is nil).

  Any high-level server events and interactions will be found in this type.

      An event that is triggered when a new player gets connected to the game. This mechanism allows developers to trigger specific actions in response to a player's connection. Note that this is not when the player's Class.Avatar is spawned. For avatar spawn, see Class.Player when in a Class.GameClient side script.
