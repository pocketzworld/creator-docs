name: AudioClip
type: classes
summary: AudioClip serves as a container for audio data, including music, voiceovers, and sound effects. It offers properties and methods to access playback details like length, samples, channels, and frequency. AudioClip supports preloading, 3D audio, and background loading. Custom AudioClip instances can be created programmatically. Fundamental for auditory experiences in Unity projects, AudioClip documentation provides further details.
