name: BoxCollider
type: classes
summary: BoxCollider is an invisible, box-shaped component that defines the physical boundaries for GameObject interactions, crucial for collision detection and physical simulations. Ideal for simple, axis-aligned shapes like crates or buildings, it can be used with Rigidbody for physics-based interactions or for event triggering areas. It allows for specifying position and dimensions relative to the GameObject it's attached to. For comprehensive understanding, the official Unity BoxCollider documentation is recommended.
