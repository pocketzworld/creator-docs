summary: Event in Highrise signifies key moments or changes in the game environment, facilitating dynamic and responsive gameplay. It provides a structured way to define, trigger, and respond to in-game occurrences, such as a player joining or leaving. Events can be triggered on specific clients, all clients, or on the server, with corresponding actions attached through connections to functions. This mechanism is pivotal for creating interactive and adaptive game experiences.
